# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression.

## Project Description
The main objectives of the project are:
- Explore and analyze credit card transaction data
- Detect fraudulent transactions
- Handle imbalanced dataset using SMOTE and class weighting
- Evaluate the model using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve

## Files
- `analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, analysis, and plots
- `README.md` - This file

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook in the project folder.
3. Run `analysis.ipynb` step by step to reproduce the analysis and plots.

## Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded from Kaggle:
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Results
All plots and analysis are displayed directly inside the Notebook. The model performance improved by handling the dataset imbalance with **SMOTE** and **balanced class weights**.
